# group18_project
This is our Space CS Invaders game, in order to run you must have a working version of java. You must download all 9 files: Avatar.java, Boss.java, BossFght.java, Bullet.java, Character.java, Enemy.java, Heart.java, MenuBox.java, Spaces.java, as well as the 5 png files. and compile the Spaces.java file, then you run the Space file to play our game. For demo 3, the final versions are in the demo-3 branch.

This our third version of the game we have a javafx based game that is similar to Space Invaders, that is an turn-based game. Our Input is WASD and “SPACE” where WASD is for the movement of the ship and “SPACE” is pressed to shoot a bullet. Currently there are five randomly generated enemies which move and shoot randomly. The number of enemies can be changed in future implementation, as levels are created. Each enemy is killed and removed if the bullet collides with the enemy. Once the ship dies, the ship is removed. If the ship is hit five times, you lose the game, if you hit all the enemies you win the game. Once the game ends, a pop-up window will show asking you to quit the game. IF you beat all five enemies, you will be able to battle a boss, once you beat the boss you will be directed back to the quit screen.

The project proposal, team contract, and class diagrams are in a zip file in d2l dropbox.

Controls for the ship: 'w' to go up 's' to go down 'a' to go left 'd' to go right 'SPACE' to shoot bullets 'q' to exit the game

References: Our game currently is based on Space Invaders developed by Taito, but will be similar to a Bullet Hell game when we are finished
